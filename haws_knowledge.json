Now is a great time to bring a new family member into your home. We continue to re-evaluate and modify our adoption procedure, with the safety of our pets and potential adopters always in mind.\nThank you for considering adopting from HAWS! Below are our general adoption procedures.\nHAWS adoption wards are open to the public for walk-throughs during viewing/adoption hours (no application is needed to walk through).\nTo view an animal one-on-one, or to enter the cat colony rooms, a current application is required.\nApplicants must be 18 years or older. A valid ID will be required in order to adopt.\nApplications can be completed both online and in person.\nIn most cases, HAWS animals will be viewed and adopted on the same day, as long as all requirements have been met!\nWhen you arrive to view an animal, we require all members of the household to be present.\n\nDOG viewings:  Bring any dogs that are currently in the home.\n\nWhen adopting, dogs are required to go home on a leash and wear a collar. A harness is encouraged, but not required. You can bring your own or purchase them at HAWS.\n\n\nCAT viewings:  Please leave your pet(s) in the comfort of your home.\n\nWhen adopting, we ask that you bring a pet carrier. If you do not have one, we will provide you with one.\n\n\nSMALL ANIMAL viewings:  Please leave your pet(s) in the comfort of your home.\n\nWhen adopting, we ask that you bring a carrier.

We look forward to guiding you through the next steps. You can also download a PDF of the adoption application here and bring it along when you visit.\nYes, now is a great time to #ADOPT4PAWSFROMHAWS!\nAdoption Fees\nCats\nKitten Adopters receive a $5 certificate good towards our Kitty College with any adoption.\nDogs\nDog Adopters receive a $25 discount certificate good towards either Life Skills for Puppies or Basic Manners 1 training classes with your puppy/dog adoption!\nSmall Animals\nAdoption fees include spay/neuter surgery, an identification microchip (dogs/cats), basic vaccinations, heartworm screening for dogs, and 2 complimentary behavior consultations for the life of your pet!\nHAWS accepts cash, credit, or debit cards as payment for adoptions.\nPost-Adoption Follow-up and Support\nPost-adoption follow-up and support are also part of our adoption procedure. Training classes and one-on-one consulting are available – just call the HAWS office to schedule. Trust HAWS as your #1 pet resource throughout the life of your pet.\nThe goal of HAWS is to find permanent, responsible, loving homes for our animals. Pets are placed as companions into homes where the animals will be thought of as part of the family and housed indoors.\nAll adopters must be 18 years of age or older, should provide verifiable identification, and be of sound mind and disposition at the time of adoption. Falsification or misrepresentation of the adoption application may cause an adoption to not be approved.\nAll adult residents in the home should be in agreement to add a pet to their household and understand that a child cannot be solely responsible for the care of a pet. It is recommended that all family members meet the pet prior to adoption when possible. While HAWS will occasionally make telephone verifications for consent to adopt, in most cases all members of the household must meet the pet face to face.\nCertain pets may require a meeting with a trainer prior to adopting.\nAdopters should maintain a relationship with a community veterinarian, and demonstrate a willingness and ability to meet the social, training, health and exercise requirements of their desired pet.\nThough we wish to see all pets go to those interested, adoption may go to the family that fits his/her needs first.\nFinding Your New Companion Animal\nAs you visit the animals in the shelter or view those available for adoption on our website, you may find several appealing prospects. However, not every animal is compatible with every family’s lifestyle. Please allow our experienced animal caregivers and adoption counselors to help with your selection by providing you information about the animal’s temperament, personality, and behavior patterns. The website is updated daily.\nA Note on FeLV and FIV Testing\nMore accurate information about Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)  tests and the diseases has led the shelter medicine community to make recommendations for shelters to discontinue routinely testing all cats for FeLV and FIV. As of April 2021, HAWS is following this recommendation and discontinuing testing for all cats. A single test at a single point in time is not representative of a cat’s true status.

This will also create a long-term solution to cat predation on wildlife.\nThe Seeking Sanctuary program is designed to give a home to cats that may be untamed, unsocial, or have problems using the litter box. Barns, stables, wineries and warehouses are all great housing alternatives – and can provide benefits to the building owner, including rodent control. In situations without any other resident “barn” cats, we suggest adopting them in pairs, as cats are social animals.\nThere is no fee for barn cat placement through HAWS, but we gladly accept monetary donations in support of this important program.\nHAWS does not recommend rehoming an outdoor cat that is already being provided with care. If you have a happy, already-settled outdoor cat, please call 262-542-8851, x109 for information on HAWS’ FREE outdoor cat spay/neuter program, Project Guardian.\nDownload:  SeekingSanctuary_BarnCats101\nYour “barn” cat will be spayed/neutered, vaccinated for rabies and tested for Feline Leukemia – FIV. Depending on the situation, cats may also receive a FVRCP vaccination, be given a dewormer and checked or treated for fleas and ear mites. In order to identify your cat as one that lives outdoors, it will receive an ear notch and/or a microchip.\nWhile HAWS is unable to provide ongoing vet care for your barn cats, HAWS strongly encourages owners to contact veterinary clinics in their area to find those that care for barn cats. Also, for those cats that are not safely handled, live/humane traps can be rented from HAWS.\nYour new cat(s) should be confined for approximately 2-4 weeks. This will allow them to become familiar with their surroundings and know where to go for food and water once allowed to roam free. We suggest using a tack room or an extra-large dog kennel for this process. During the adjustment time, we suggest feeding canned food so the cat will associate the high-value treat with its new feeding place (you do not need to continue to feed canned food once the cat is released). The cat should have access to a litter box even if one will not be used once that cat is released. Place a box or a smaller kennel inside the area facing away from the door; this will give the cat(s) a place to hide and feel safe when you come by to clean and feed.\nOnce your cat(s) is ready to start exploring its new home you can simply open the door and let them roam free. It is import to do this during the daytime so you can observe and watch for any problems that might occur. If you have other cats on the property, they may scuffle and make odd noises during their initial encounters; this is perfectly normal and determines their social order. Within time they will learn to coexist.\nEven though your barn cat(s) main job will be to control the mice population, it is still important to offer food and water daily. Cats cannot live on mice alone. Feeding will also keep the cat(s) from wandering too far or finding another barn that offers food. Most cats will have a natural instinct to hunt for mice, so withholding meals will not mean that they will catch more mice. Continue to feed your cat(s) in the same spot and call them when it is time to eat by saying “here kitty kitty kitty.” During the cold winter months, we suggest making a cozy insulated shelter to keep your barn cat(s) warm and safe.\nUnited States+1\nUnited Kingdom+44\nAfghanistan+93\nAlbania+355\nAlgeria+213\nAmerican Samoa+1\nAndorra+376\nAngola+244\nAnguilla+1\nAntigua & Barbuda+1\nArgentina+54\nArmenia+374\nAruba+297\nAscension Island+247\nAustralia+61\nAustria+43\nAzerbaijan+994\nBahamas+1\nBahrain+973\nBangladesh+880\nBarbados+1\nBelarus+375\nBelgium+32\nBelize+501\nBenin+229\nBermuda+1\nBhutan+975\nBolivia+591\nBosnia & Herzegovina+387\nBotswana+267\nBrazil+55\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory+246\nBritish Virgin Islands+1\nBrunei+673\nBulgaria+359\nBurkina Faso+226\nBurundi+257\nCambodia+855\nCameroon+237\nCanada+1\nCape Verde+238\nCaribbean Netherlands+599\nCayman Islands+1\nCentral African Republic+236\nChad+235\nChile+56\nChina+86\nChristmas Island+61\nCocos (Keeling) Islands+61\nColombia+57\nComoros+269\nCongo - Brazzaville+242\nCongo - Kinshasa+243\nCook Islands+682\nCosta Rica+506\nCroatia+385\nCuba+53\nCuraçao+599\nCyprus+357\nCzechia+420\nCôte d’Ivoire+225\nDenmark+45\nDjibouti+253\nDominica+1\nDominican Republic+1\nEcuador+593\nEgypt+20\nEl Salvador+503\nEquatorial Guinea+240\nEritrea+291\nEstonia+372\nEswatini+268\nEthiopia+251\nFalkland Islands+500\nFaroe Islands+298\nFiji+679\nFinland+358\nFrance+33\nFrench Guiana+594\nFrench Polynesia+689\nGabon+241\nGambia+220\nGeorgia+995\nGermany+49\nGhana+233\nGibraltar+350\nGreece+30\nGreenland+299\nGrenada+1\nGuadeloupe+590\nGuam+1\nGuatemala+502\nGuernsey+44\nGuinea+224\nGuinea-Bissau+245\nGuyana+592\nHaiti+509\nHonduras+504\nHong Kong SAR China+852\nHungary+36\nIceland+354\nIndia+91\nIndonesia+62\nIran+98\nIraq+964\nIreland+353\nIsle of Man+44\nIsrael+972\nItaly+39\nJamaica+1\nJapan+81\nJersey+44\nJordan+962\nKazakhstan+7\nKenya+254\nKiribati+686\nKosovo+383\nKuwait+965\nKyrgyzstan+996\nLaos+856\nLatvia+371\nLebanon+961\nLesotho+266\nLiberia+231\nLibya+218\nLiechtenstein+423\nLithuania+370\nLuxembourg+352\nMacao SAR China+853\nMadagascar+261\nMalawi+265\nMalaysia+60\nMaldives+960\nMali+223\nMalta+356\nMarshall Islands+692\nMartinique+596\nMauritania+222\nMauritius+230\nMayotte+262\nMexico+52\nMicronesia+691\nMoldova+373\nMonaco+377\nMongolia+976\nMontenegro+382\nMontserrat+1\nMorocco+212\nMozambique+258\nMyanmar (Burma)+95\nNamibia+264\nNauru+674\nNepal+977\nNetherlands+31\nNew Caledonia+687\nNew Zealand+64\nNicaragua+505\nNiger+227\nNigeria+234\nNiue+683\nNorfolk Island+672\nNorth Korea+850\nNorth Macedonia+389\nNorthern Mariana Islands+1\nNorway+47\nOman+968\nPakistan+92\nPalau+680\nPalestinian Territories+970\nPanama+507\nPapua New Guinea+675\nParaguay+595\nPeru+51\nPhilippines+63\nPoland+48\nPortugal+351\nPuerto Rico+1\nQatar+974\nRomania+40\nRussia+7\nRwanda+250\nRéunion+262\nSamoa+685\nSan Marino+378\nSaudi Arabia+966\nSenegal+221\nSerbia+381\nSeychelles+248\nSierra Leone+232\nSingapore+65\nSint Maarten+1\nSlovakia+421\nSlovenia+386\nSolomon Islands+677\nSomalia+252\nSouth Africa+27\nSouth Korea+82\nSouth Sudan+211\nSpain+34\nSri Lanka+94\nSt. Barthélemy+590\nSt. Helena+290\nSt. Kitts & Nevis+1\nSt. Lucia+1\nSt. Martin+590\nSt. Pierre & Miquelon+508\nSt. Vincent & Grenadines+1\nSudan+249\nSuriname+597\nSvalbard & Jan Mayen+47\nSweden+46\nSwitzerland+41\nSyria+963\nSão Tomé & Príncipe+239\nTaiwan+886\nTajikistan+992\nTanzania+255\nThailand+66\nTimor-Leste+670\nTogo+228\nTokelau+690\nTonga+676\nTrinidad & Tobago+1\nTunisia+216\nTurkey+90\nTurkmenistan+993\nTurks & Caicos Islands+1\nTuvalu+688\nU.S. Virgin Islands+1\nUganda+256\nUkraine+380\nUnited Arab Emirates+971\nUnited Kingdom+44\nUnited States+1\nUruguay+598\nUzbekistan+998\nVanuatu+678\nVatican City+39\nVenezuela+58\nVietnam+84\nWallis & Futuna+681\nWestern Sahara+212\nYemen+967\nZambia+260\nZimbabwe+263\nÅland Islands+358\nYes\nNo\nPlease contact HAWS with any questions or concerns!

Along with helping curb pet overpopulation, spay/neuter surgery allows pets to live longer, healthier lives. It also makes ​them less likely to spray and/or mark territory and eliminates heat cycles. ​Unsterilized animals often exhibit more behavior and temperament problems ​than those who have been spayed or neutered.\nHAWS is saving lives through Project Guardian, our no-cost spay-neuter program for outdoor cats, and through Seeking Sanctuary, our alternative placement program for non-social cats. Please click on the links to learn more!\nFor more information on HAWS’ SNIP services, please contact the clinic directly at 262-542-8852.\nAFTER you have scheduled your surgical appointment, please complete our online Surgical Registration Form. Please do not fill out the registration form for appointments other than surgery.\n* Please note, a current rabies vaccination certificate is required for animals undergoing procedures at HAWS’ SNIP clinic. If your animal does not have a current rabies vaccination, one will be given at the time of the appointment.\nBut it’s not only spaying and neutering for HAWS’ team! Our veterinarians oversee the medical needs of every animal in the shelter to ensure they are healthy and adoptable. Procedures include dentals and dental care, non-surgical medical treatments, on-going medical treatments, amputations, biopsies, lump removals, bladder stone removal, intestinal blockage removal, heartworm treatments and more. The vets at HAWS are true caregivers for animals in need.\nThe SNIP program at HAWS is poised to make a far-reaching and lasting impact on the animal population in our community, but that cannot continue without your support.",

Each month there is a new topic and activities for you and your child to enjoy!\nFamily Adventures\nDoes your whole family love animals and the outdoors? Come learn more about both and how we make sure they are well kept at the Schallock Center for Animals.  Have fun together as you explore the habitats and visit our resident animals. Each season will have a different theme so pick a date that works for you and come join us.\nTales by the Fire\nEnjoy an evening outdoors with your family at the Schallock Center for Animals. Bring a picnic, hike the trails and listen to a story about animals around the campfire.  We’ll share with you how HAWS can help you, your pets and our community. Then finish the night with a fun campfire snack.\nHannah’s Haven\nThis reading program is in loving memory of Hannah, a HAWS alumni dog, whose greatest joy and achievement was working with children at HAWS, local schools, libraries, and at community events.\nChildren ages 6 to 10 can spend a half hour reading to one of the shelter dogs or HAWS alumni dogs. Research has shown that “the presence of a calm, attentive dog” when children are reading aloud reduces stress and improves concentration much more than a supportive adult, or even a friend. Animals in shelters are often lonely and in need of interaction and socialization. Reading to animals at a shelter can give them some much-needed one-on-one time with a companion in a calm setting. There are two reading stalls available to reserve for each time slot.\nClubs for Kids\nTuesday Troops\nTuesday Troops is for animal-loving kids in 6th through 8th grades to volunteer at HAWS and socialize with many of our adoptable animals. Meeting nights consist of two to three Tuesdays per month and run for a school semester.\nCritter Club\nCritter Club is a unique education and volunteer opportunity for kids in 6th through 8th grades who have a passion to help and protect animals. Critter Club members attend educational programs on Thursdays and also has them spend time volunteering at HAWS on Saturday or Sunday mornings alongside one of our HAWS educators. Critter Club sessions run for a school semester.\nCritter Club members will have to apply for membership, submit recommendations from two non-related adults (teachers, ministers, scout leaders, etc), and write an essay about why pets are important.\nKHAWS\nKHAWS is a club for kids ages 6 to 12 years old to learn about animal safety and pet care responsibilities while interacting with the shelter’s animals. Meetings are held two Friday nights a month per semester. Each month will feature an animal-related activity, after which we will participate in several activities around the shelter such as socializing with animals and making pet toys and treats!\nPETS\nEager to help animals and learn about the mission of HAWS? Need service hours? This is a semester long, once a month opportunity available to high school students in grades 9-12th. Students will earn service hours as they learn about the various needs of cats, dogs and the other small animals that HAWS cares for. Students will participate in a variety of service opportunities. The type of projects we do will be dependent upon HAWS needs at the time but may include projects like cleaning (doing dishes, folding laundry, etc.), enrichment preparation, sorting donations, and animal socialization. We recommend students wear clothes and shoes they don’t mind getting dirty and shoes must be closed-toe (no crocs). We are going to get hands-on and help take care of our animals at HAWS! Your student service hours will be recorded at each attendance and at the end of the semester HAWS will sign your service log to submit as needed.\nEquine Explorers\nEquine Explorers is for horse-loving kids in 6th-9th grade! Kids will have the unique opportunity to learn about, care for, and interact with horses at HAWS Schallock Center for Animals.  We will cover a wide variety of topics – equine safety, types of equipment, riding styles, equine history, horse anatomy, and more! Meeting days are Tuesdays.\nEquine Explorer members will have to apply for membership indicating their interest in horses and this club.  Our resident horses can’t wait to meet you!\nEquine Explorers 2 & 3\nThis club is for kids in 6th-9th grade who have completed the first semester of Equine Explorers. This advanced offering provides additional opportunities to ride and gain more independence and confidence working with the horses. We will also be learning more about the responsibilities of caring for horses by helping with chores and other needed tasks around the Schallock Center for Animals. Meeting days are Sundays and Mondays.\nEquine Explorer 2 members will have to apply for membership indicating why they wish to continue learning about horses and how to care for them.\n*NEW!* Jr. Equine Explorers\n“Critter Club was a very important part of my life in middle and high school. I was able to create lifelong friendships, learn more about animals and learn more about myself as a person. Critter Club also lead me to work in the Education Department as a Camp Counselor/Humane Educator, which has taught me many great life lessons and allowed me to pursue a career in Special Education! I would highly recommend HAWS education programming to kids who have an interest in animals and wants to meet others who have similar interests.” – Melissa",
